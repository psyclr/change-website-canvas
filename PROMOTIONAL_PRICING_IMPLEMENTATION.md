const finalPrice = Math.max(0, basePrice - discountAmount);

// With maximum discount cap
const cappedDiscount = Math.min(discountAmount, maxDiscountAmount);
const finalPrice = basePrice - cappedDiscount;
```

### Eligibility Validation
```typescript
const eligibility = {
  customerType: userContext.customerType === 'new',
  region: ['PL', 'EU'].includes(userContext.region),
  timing: now >= validFrom && now <= validTo,
  usageLimit: currentUses < maxUses,
  packageEligible: applicablePackages.includes(packageId)
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Hook Usage
```tsx
// Basic usage
const { packages, hasActivePromotions } = usePricing({
  customerType: 'new',
  region: 'PL'
});

// Package-specific usage
const { package: startPackage, isOnPromotion } = usePackagePricing('start', {
  customerType: 'new',
  region: 'PL'
});
```

### Component Integration
```tsx
// Promotional badges
{pkg.appliedPromotion && (
  <NewClientBadge 
    promotion={pkg.appliedPromotion}
    showCountdown={true}
  />
)}

// Savings display
{pkg.savings > 0 && (
  <SavingsIndicator
    savings={pkg.savings}
    originalPrice={pkg.originalPrice}
  />
)}
